The Timetable  generator is meant to generate scheduled timetables for academic courses.
It is designed help students keep track of when their classes start and which venues are the classes taking place. 
Lectures also use the Timetable generator to update venues if needed.

Features in the Timetable generator:

            The generator will be a progressive web application, which makes it available on mobile devices and desktops. 
            The introductory interface consist of a log in and register button to allow the user to register and log in afterwards.
            A registered user has access to time slots and venues in which his/her lectures are held.
            Lectures users have features to help them update the venues of the web application.

At the moment our web application is able to register and allow a student user to log in  using the registered  student number and password.
